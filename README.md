## Data Set : Chicago Crime Dataset 

### Problem Statement 
The purpose of this project is to understand the nature of crimes occuring in different regions of Chicago city and build a framework that will allow us to predict the level of threat ( or "degree of criminal activity ) in each region.
This will enable the Chicago PD to allocate resources in high impact areas and subsequently bring down the overall crime rate of the city. 
Another important outcome of this project is to understand the major drivers of crime in certain regions and take targetted pre-emptive actions for those locations like imposing curfews and sending out text alerts to residents.
